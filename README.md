# EGI PyNetStation

## About this tool
This python package enables the use of a Python API to synchronize with a
NetStation amplifier.
You can install the latest "stable" version from pip (though even these are
still experimental):

```
pip install egi-pynetstation
```

If you would like to install the current codebase, you can clone it:

```
git clone https://github.com/nimh-sfim/egi-pynetstation.git
cd egi-pynetstation
pip install -e .
```
